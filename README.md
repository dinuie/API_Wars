1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
4. Create a new file called .env in the root directory of the project.
5. Add the necessary environment variables to the .env file, including database details and any other required configuration variables.
